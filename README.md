we designed a phonebook app program using java that does basic function like insert contacts, search for contact, display all contact, delete contact, update contact, sort contact (alphabetically following the contact name) from our phonebook app.

we used linkedlist as our data structure as it allow us to dynamically manage contacts, making it easier to insert and delete contacts without worrying about fixed sizes.
